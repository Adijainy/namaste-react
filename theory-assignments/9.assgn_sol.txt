● - What would happen if we do console.log(useState())?
A- it returns an array with 1st element undefined and 2nd element a function.

● - How will useEffect behave if we don't add a dependency array ?
A- It will keep running after every render and after any update in the UI.

● - What is SPA?
A- A Single Page Application (SPA) is a website or web application that dynamically rewrites an existing web page with new information from the web server. In a React application, components retrieve site content and render it to a single HTML file in your project.

● - What is difference between Client Side Routing and Server Side Routing?
A- In the server-side routing, when we exchange data, we send requests and response.
- A server-side request causes the whole page to refresh. This is because a new GET request is sent to the server which responds with a new document, completely discarding the old page altogether.

- in the client-side case, we are not doing that. We are reading the URL, and we are re-rendering the page.
- When a user clicks on a link, the URL changes but the request to the server is prevented. The adjustment to the URL will result in a changed state of the application.
